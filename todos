TODO: write the generatePassword function
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
TODO: ask the user how many character they want in the password -> use a prompt which will be set to a var -> make sure the information is correct -> number -> 8+ or 128-
TODO: ask the user how many character they want in the password -> use a prompt which will be set to a var -> console.log(passwordlength) -> make sure the information is correct -> number -> 8+ or 128-
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
TODO: write a series of 4 confirms -> set these to be a var -> to check if the user wants

WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
TODO: check that we have at least one of the types
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
TODO: take our holding array and randomize the characters -> adding to a second array
TODO: take the randomized characters and select the amount the amount the user has chosen for the password length -> add these to a "return array" -> for loop the length for this will be the user password length
