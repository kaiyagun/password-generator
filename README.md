A simple and easy password generator that gathers preferences by using a series of confirmations to create a custom randomized password.

Clicking "Generate Password" (which is a cool looking button, just saying) will generate a question where the user can specify how many characters they would like in their password. From there, they go through a series of confirmations that decide which characters will be used in the password.

The final generated password will appear in the textarea box in the center of the page.
